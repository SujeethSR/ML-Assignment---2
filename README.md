CSE-6363-008 Programming Assignment 2 (Spring 2024)

## Name : Sujeeth Sundarajan Rajkumar
## UTA ID : 1002153693
## Overview
This setup guide is for the Ensemble Learning Assignment, focusing on the practical application of Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forests, and Adaboost using the Iris dataset.

## Environment Setup
1. **Python Installation:** Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Required Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```
    pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

    These libraries are essential for data manipulation (NumPy, SciPy), machine learning algorithms (scikit-learn), and visualization (matplotlib).

## Running the Code
- After setting up the environment, download the provided `ensemble_learning.py` script.
- Execute the script in your terminal with `python ensemble_learning.py`.
- Follow the instructions within the script to complete the implementation.

Ensure all the steps are followed correctly to set up the environment for running the ensemble learning models.
